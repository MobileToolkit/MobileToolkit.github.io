I'm proud to announce that Storybard Navigator v1.0.0 is released!

This framework makes navigation between multiple storyboards possible from Interface Builder level. Just add it in your project & you're ready to change your monolythic storyboard app into a modular one (without any additional source code changes).

Main highlights of this release are:
  
  * support for creating segues via **Interface Builder**
  * support for creating segues to a specific ViewController in a storyboard (via **Storyboard ID**)
  * support for creating segues to the **Initial View Controller** in a storyboard
  * segues to perform **push storyboard** or **present modally storyboard**

You can download the framework [here][storyboard-navigator-release]{:target="_blank"}.
